# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2024 project! This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## Running the Solutions

Each solution is written in TypeScript and can be run using `npx tsx`. To execute a specific solution, use the following command:

```sh
npx tsx path/to/solution.ts
```

Replace `path/to/solution.ts` with the relative path to the TypeScript file you want to run.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── day1
│   ├── part1.ts
│   └── part2.ts
├── day2

...
```

Each day's challenge is contained within its own directory, with separate files for each part of the challenge.
